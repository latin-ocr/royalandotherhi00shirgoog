PREFACE.

Tun present volume 01 letters differe from its· predecessor
in 000 or two respecta It was found, when the period
of the barons’ wara came to be examined in detail, that
to carry out in full the plan of the first volume wne
impraoticable. To have printed from the Ulose and
Patent Rolls every unpubliahed letter 01 interest which
bore 00 the events referred 10 in the Royal letters would ·
have extended the work altogether beyond the limito
contemplated. Moreover, it would 001 have been, when
done, a really complete work, for many entries on the
Rolls, which are not properly letters, are 0011000100-
portant, nor lesu deoerving 01 publication. 'l'hie ie espe-
cially true of the Patent Roll 01 49 Ηο0. ΙΙΙ. 'Po have
made any adequate extracta from thie roll alone would
have occupied more then fifty pagee3 and aster all, the
extracta would only have lest the feeling that the roll
should be printed in full Ι1 hae, therefore, been 1010
untonched, and, generally, throughout the period 01 the
actual war of the barone the 00100010 have been made
with a very scanty hand, compared with the materiola
available They munt evidently be dealt with 01 sorne
timeon 0 neele altogether larger than the plan 01 thio
work allows. 'I'he collection of bullo which appeared in
the Appendix 10 the snat volume hae been discontinued.
It hae been considered inelevant and unintereeting, and
has therefore been withdrawn to give roorn for a larger
aelection of letters.
