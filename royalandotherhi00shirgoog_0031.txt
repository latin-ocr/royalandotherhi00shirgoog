certain as it is whether the royal summons at least
received any measure of obedience‚ it is yet valuable as
the first instance in which representatives of the counties
were called together for a purely political purpose.

The next instances arc the two parliaments which
were held in June 1264 and J anuary 1265, while the

other. To the first belongs his great course of legislation‚

crowded with the affairs of France aud Scotland. It is
precisely atthis moment of transition from the even
course of legislation to foreign politice and war, that the
House of Commoris first appears in a true constitutional
sense as a recognized estate of the realm. Edward could
legislate without the Commons, but he could not without

them maintaina great foreign policy. It was not the
