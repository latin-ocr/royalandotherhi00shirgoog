s It might seem te us at first sight so obvious te resert in
such a ease te a system ef representation, that it requires
some reflectien te see that anything else was possible,
and seme little knowledge ef general history te remind
us how difficolt it is fer a new pelitieal idea te take
therough reet in society.

Fer this reason it is of great interest te nete every
mede ef obtaining either a censent to taxatien er an ’
expression ef pelitieal opinion, in the widast sense el
the werd, which ison the ene hand net properly repre-
sentative, or en the ether indicates an approach tea ,
complete electeral system. Of this last the three great
criteria are-l. Free electien. 2. Assemblege of repre· '
sentatives. 3. Adequate powers when resembled. Wher-
ever these three are wanting, it may be considered that
there is properly speaking no representative system.

Judged by this criterien, it was net c representation
when the greater herens were presumed to speak the
sense ef the less. It was not representation when at a ’
later date, and in part certainly to avoid the necessity fer
a real Hense ef Gemmeus, the erewn summoned te the
great eeuneil the new order of barone by writ, ef men
noble, that is, not by tenure ef land, but by persenal
servies te the crewn. It was not representation, again,
when the eherill's were ordered, in 1231, to send six es
the riehest Jews from each town in which there was a
Jews’ quarter, in order te confer with the king upon
their artears ef tallage. It is net representation, bet a
mode ef politica] action in distinet oppositien to it, ’
when the lower clergy are told, as in 1270, by a circulsr
letter, that it is impossible te summan a Parliament;
but that it is heped that they will, nevertheless‚ grant
an aid, as the bisheps and abbets bave already dene.¹
