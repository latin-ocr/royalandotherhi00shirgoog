The works to be published in octavo, separately, as
they were finished3 the whole responsibility of the task
resting upon the editore, who were to be chosen by the
Master of the Rolls with the sanction of the Treasrn‘y.

The Lords of Her Majesty’s Treasury, arur a careful
consideration of the subject, expressed their opinion in a
Clheasury Minuta, dated February 9, 1857, that tho plan
recommended by the Master of the Rolls “was well

calculated for the accomph'shment of this important ,

national object, in an effectual and satisfactory manner,
within a reasonable time, and provided proper attention be
paid to economy, in making the detailed anangements,
without unneoessary expense.”

They expressed their approbation of the proposal that
each chronicle and historical document should be edited
in such a manner asto represent with all possible eorrect-
ness the text of each writer, derived from a collation of the
best MSS, and that no notes should be added, except
such as were illustrativc of the various readings. They
suggested, however, that the prefece toeaoh work should
oontain, in addition to the particulare proposed hythe
Master ol the Rolls, abiographieal account of the author,
so far as authentia materiale 'existed lor that purpose,
and an estimate of his historice] credibility and velue.
