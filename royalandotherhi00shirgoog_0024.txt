for the maintenancc of this privilege, is evidence that it
had been infringed3 und the some document, in giving
us the first distinct intimation cf the privilege of the
earls and berone to be tried only by their peers, shows
that the leoeer berone—nc longer called by that nnme-
had fallen into the bsclrground, eud were already, pro·
bably, causing to attend, unless in ceses when personal
business, or some altogether exceptional circumstance,
drew thern to the court.

This would, perhaps, iu itself have occasioned no·
embnrrsssment; the rule thet the absent members of

present, and the fewer, or less importent, by thet of the
