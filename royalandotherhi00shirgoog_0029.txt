how easy the transition may be from judicial to political
functione. The election of four knights, then, to repre-
sent their county was early in the thirteenth century}
tend probably a good deal earlier, a familiar and ordinary

practice And the very county court in which these
knights were elected was itself at least, in part, a repre-
sentative assemhly. A writ addressed in the year 1231
to the sheriff 01 York¹ describes more fully than usual
the constitution 01 the county court as it existed at thot
tirne. He is bidden to summon all the archbishopa,
bishops, abbate, priors, carle, barone, knights, and all the
freeholders within his jurisdiction ; and from every
town (01110) four law-worthy men, and the headsman;
and 110111 every borough throughout his jurisdiction
twelve law-worthy burgesses, “and all others who are
“ wont and ought 10 001110 before our justices in eyre.''
0 ¹ Thus the practice of electing representatives had taken
root in England. To assemble thern was the next great
step. We shall do well 1011010 carefully the precise
object and circumstances 01 the first meetings 01 a repre·
sentative ussemhly in England. The earliest by many
years consisted of four discreet knights lrom every county‚
who were summoned to meet king John at Oxford on ¹
the l3th 01 December 1213, “ad loquendum nobiscum
“ de negociis regni nostri.''² This was exactly a week
after the clergy had met the king to obtain from hirn an
¹essessment of the compensation due 10 thern for the ahnost
incalculable losses sudered by the church during the six
‘years 01 the interdict. Itis clear that the extraor-
dinary rneeting 01 the knights in the following week
was connected with the extraordinary paynrents which
they might be called upon to bear. The object then 01
the summoue was twofold: to induce the elergy to
moderate their demands under· sear· 01 a storin 01 lay
