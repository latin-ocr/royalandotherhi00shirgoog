into new life. The way was made easy, by paying a
fine, for removing any caum from the baronial to the
county court, into which the justioes in syre intro-
duced by degrees a simpler and more equitable procedure,
and in which, before long, the barbarous ordcal and

combat were mado to give way to the newly-invented l·
trial hy jury. d

It need hardly be observed that trial by jury is in
some sense a representative instituticn; aad that for
this reason it is often called trial by the country. But
the functione of the county court were not confined lo
what would now be considered the work of a court oi
law. Even the collection of the royal revenue took a
judicial form. 'l'he Great Charter here, as in other cases, Ο

Here then we have four knights of the shira elected(

In the ninth year of Henry 111„ the year iu which the
Grcat Oharter was recast into the dorm which it still
retains on the statute book, the duties of the four
knights received a remarkable extensior. It was err-y
pressly ordered that the subsidies granted iu parliament
should be assessed by knights chosen freely in the
county court, in conjunctior wilh the royal justices3
that is, that the subsidias should ba placed on the precise
footing of the assiae cf novel disseisin. The arrange·
ment was not repeated3 but it indicates, thus early,
