while they are in office, shall not ask or take of any
man, olerk or lay, haemmi or villain, of any religione
house, or of any town, lamb, sheaf, corn, nor wool, nor
any manner of moveable, nor money, nor anything of
velue, as very many have been went in time past.
This the eheritf shall make them swear when be puts
them in office. And that the counties, hundreda, wa-
pentakes, οι· other· bailliwioks of onr realm shall be
farmed to none.

And let the aberitis and all other manner of bailiffs
be sure that if any is eonvieted of taking any manner
of other price than is written above by reason of hia
office, he shall be put to ransom, and the givet as well
as the receives for we have provided by the eounsel of
our high men that for ever there shall be halland
quiok right done to all, without any manner of hire.
And therefore we commend and forbid to all, men and‘
women, that to none of our bailiffs they offer or pro·
mise or give, on pain of being put to ransom. For
when the aheriff eomes to the head of the year, on his
noeount he shall be allowed the reasonable expensas
which he shall have incurred in rnaintaining his office,
both for himself and for the hire of his servants And
therefore we give them of oure, because we will that
they have no oooaeion to take ought of others, and we
will that none of our bailiffs that we plaoe in our land,
whether eheriff or other, romain in his offioe more than
one year. And therefore we give you to know that if
hardahips or wrongs be done to you by the aforesaid
bailiffa you may the less doubt and more fearlessly
show their wronga

Witness ourselves at westminster, the twentieth day
of October, in the year of our reign the forty-seoond.
