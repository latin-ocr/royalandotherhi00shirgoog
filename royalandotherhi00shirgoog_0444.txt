we had ordained. The third day alter the proclamation
my attorniea eume to hold the king’s pleae at the custom-
house, and to do other things that were enjoined them.
There came william Fitz John and John Fitz «loseph.
They had there full thirty armed men with intent
against the peace. 'l'hey seized my people that were
there on bahali of the king, and feloniously threw them
on the ground and beat and trampled on them and
dangerously woundeu them, so that they with great
difficulty escaped to the church, and robhed them of
the king's rollo, and tha entreats which the eheriff sent
me just as they were, and three gold ringo, and part
of the amerciamente which they had in pocket, and
inany other things which the bearer of the letters will
tell you by word of mouth. Wherel‘ore, dear sir, Ι
pray your lordship that you will pleone to take quick
oounsel on this affair, for never yet wae there so gneat
need as now, that we ought to begin to take the
profit of the king and the profit of the poor people‚
hom which they should have their suetmance through
the year. And if quick aid be not given, no foreigner
will dare to come, and those of the town with their
merchandize will betake themselves to another port,
without returning, as they say.

And since you told me, sir, that I should eoften
them hy gentlencss in treating them kindly, and by a
fair and peaceable manner, I did all in my power, and
it comes to nothing, and neither gentlenese nor comtesy
will ever avuil anything. On the other hand, sir, Iam
too weak to guard niyself against such malicious people;
if Ι have uo other aid ¹promptly and loyally,si1·‚ I sear

much lest the king should lose by my default. If my .

lord Rohert de Bufford were in the country 1 should
not care And those of the town, who are peaeeably

'disposed when they see their enemies armed, do not
dare to do anything against them ; so much they doubt
