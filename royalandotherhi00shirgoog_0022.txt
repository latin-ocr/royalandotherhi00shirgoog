For the next three months we henr os nothing but os
agents basy at the court of Rome to procuro sor the
king a release from sll his obligations mors absolute
than any yet granted. In this field the success of the
king was complete. At an earlier dato we read os proe-
tors and montet-prociona, both armed with a seemingly
equal authority, but uttering language the most oppo-
site3 we hear of many enemies in the popnl court,
and the prejudiees of the pope himself; but noir, aller
great difficulties, the royal proetor reporta that hs has
obtained a bull revoking in the most absolute manner
every aet and ‹leed oi the baronial couneil of twenty-four.

On the ind of May 1262 the papal ahsolution was
proclaimed by the royal letters patent¹ On the 11th
of May we hear of a fresh arbitration between the eorl
oi Gloneester and the king.2 This timo the nomo of
Montfort is significantly absent. He had withdrawn
‹lisheartened to the continent, deelaring that whatever
it might be to others, the oatb ol Oxford was binding
still to him. ,

In the month of J uly, Glouoester died ; and with him
well nigh expireil the hopeless series of arbitrations
which complicato so strangely the history of the pre-
ceding fifteen months. Montfort who, by his death,
sneoeeded to the sole leadership oi the party, was not
diaposed to ronow them, unless he could have some

reasonable hope of their leading to a losting peace.
