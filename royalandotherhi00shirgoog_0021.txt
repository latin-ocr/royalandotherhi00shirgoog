xii raasson

alsa of September.¹ The summons issued in the joint
names of the earls of Leioester and Glaucester, and of
Walter Cantilupe, bishop of Worecstor, names which
show that the whole baronial party was onae more re-
united. The king issued a counter-summons, ordering
the knights to come to him at Windsor‚ instead of to the
barone at St. Alban's.

It seems probable that he was not oheyed, soron
the leth of October we find another royal procla-
motion⁹ against certain persons who had presumed to
remove from their offioes the sheriffs and bailiffs ap-
pointed by tha orown. On the aare we hear more of
foreign mercenaries, and everything might seem to por-
tend an immediate appeal to arms. But in feet the
decisivo move of the barone seems to have had the effert
of bringing the king toa juster sense of his position.
For the endless attempts at arbitration,—-the only possible
expedient where the demands of both parties are too
high to allow of their maeting-there was substituted
apparently a direct negociation ; it was agreed, as to the
main point now at issue, that the countiee should present
to the king four persons, out oi whom he should choose
{the sheriff3 the eommission os the twenty-four was
brought, it would seem, to an end, and an ample amnesty
proalaimed.³

Yet before two months had expired we find another
arbitration going forward upon the same interminable
question ol the eheriff. The king was to name three
persons and the barone three; if they eould not agree,
the king of the Romans was to decide. As might have
been expected, the six commissionem were divided three
and three, and Richard pronounoed in favour of the
labeolute freedom of the crown to appoint the sheriffs at
pleaaure.
