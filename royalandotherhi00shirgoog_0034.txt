PREFACE. xxv

St. Richnrd οι chichester, and the incessant efforts ol
prootor atter praetor to obtain a lull and unconditionul
absolutiou οι the king from the engagenrants ha hod
rnade ιο his barone.

Scaroaly lass rare, at ao early a date, though wholly
differrent in kind, are tha letters written to tha chanoellor,
Ralph Neville, bishop of Chichester, hythe steward of
his private estates, and which have strayed by sonae
fortunate accident into tha bundles of public lettera pre·
served hy the chanoellor'a official care. The marling of
the hishop's land, and the erectiora of his windrnill, then
acomparatively new invention3 tho impossibility ol
selling his old wine, because new wine was so abundant
at Chichaste1·; the purchase of eloth for distribution ιο
the poor; the sending donkeys from London ιο Sussex
to carry a supply of liuh, the advice that the choneellor
should send an invitation ιο the urchbishop of (lanter-
bury-no particular friend-which it would bo creditable
ιο give, and which it is known ho will not aceept; the
writs to reolaim the chanoellor’s runaway nerlu the
report of the audacious chaplain, who keeps two wives,
and claime a papal dispensation 3 the shuffiing ahbot of
Seen, who cannot hesepe ιο his bargain—all these are
details which bring home with vividness the domestic
lile oi the period.

To the editor himself, what has seemed the most dis·
tinctive interest of the lettera arises from the insight which
they give into tho practica] working os the governrnent.
What justioes, and sheritla, and seneschals, ond proctora
really did; where the abusos of the governnrent really
lay; how far the powerful and the rich could or could
not dely or evade the law; how rnuoh was dependent
on the personal character of the sove1·eign; how far or
how olten the careor of a statssman was really open ιο a
subject ; what were the every-day relations between the

Church and State-these are things which can ba really
learnt from the letters now before us3 they can be known
