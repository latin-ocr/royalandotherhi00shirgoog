renasca. xvii

A more remarkable case is contained in a letter of
Geoffrey Neville who, in 1220, acting‚ it would seem, as
eberill', had demanded a tallage of the lreemsn ol York-
abire He says that he hnd summoned the earls, barone,
and the lreemen concerned The only persons who are
named ns having actually come are the seneschals and
bailiffs 01 “the aforesaid 1ηο300100.η They objected on
the ground that their lurda, like those ol the rest of
England, ought to have been selred either vico voce by
the king, or by his own letters They, therefore, de-
manded an adjourument to the next oounty day, in
order that meantime they might consult their lorda¹

Here there is clearly no representation; but there is
rnuch that is remarkable, and, indeed, perplexing. The
principle, so important in itself, and so positively laid
down in the Great Oharter, that no tallage should be
levied without the assent 01 the “commune consilium
“ regni,''is abandoned without aword of protest: the
borona would bare been perfeotly satisfied if erich ol
them had received a royal letter of request; but they
resented the collective summoue which placed thern
upon the level of the other freemen. On the other hand,
so lar as we can see, the lesser lreemen, though sum·'
moned, take no part in the transaction, and do not seem
· to have expected that they should be seriouely consulted.

A few cases mentioned in the Royal Lattara are eo
doubtful, that it is hard to know whether to consider
them as instances 01 representation or not. For in·
stance, in Oct. 1222, we find² six Scotch and six
English knights chosen hy their respective natione to
perambulate and fix the berder. Agoin, in 1229,ι the
inhabitante of a pert 01 tha Welsh border claimed an
immunity from tallage. The eherill' who had assessed it
upon them is ordered to send twelve ‘¹ de discretioribus
